# MultiFlow

This repository supplies the code developed in the study of AUTHORS **_"TITLE"_**. The corresponding pre-print can be found on bioRxiv ( doi: DOI ). It can be used to reproduce the results of the study and investigate the methodology to be used for other datasets.

# **System Requirements**
## **Hardware Recommendations:**
The code contained in this repository requires only a standard computer to run, however, the amount of RAM required will be defined by the desires of the use. For low level performance, 2 GB of RAM should suffice. For optimal performance, a minimum of 16 GB of RAM and 8 Cores with 2.9 GHz/core is recommended. These specifications match the laboratory computer specifications that the code was tested on.

The runtimes below were generated with a computer with the optimal specifications (16 GB RAM and 8 Cores @ 2.9 GHz/core) and an internet download speed of DOWNLOAD SPEED Mbps.

## **Software Recommendations:**
* Computer Operating System: Tested on Windows 10, version VERSION
* The code was originally written using R version VERSION. along with a corresponding version of RStudio. Most recent testing done using R version VERSION and RStudio version VERSION
* To use the provided code, you will need to install the following R libraries: R LIBRARIES AND VERSIONS

# **Data**

All necessary data is provided via WHERE IS THE DATA.

# **Instructions**
## **Installation Guide**
* The latest version of R can be downloaded at https://www.r-project.org/ and should download in under one minute
* The latest version of RStudio can be downloaded at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and should install in under one minute
* Download the files from the repository and extract the files from the zip folder to your desired working folder. The extraction process should be near instantaneous.
* Open the NUMBER provided R scripts and change the address in the setwd() command on each file to reflect the folder you saved the files to. The scripts should open instanteously.
* Ensure all R Libraries listed in the Software Requirements are installed. Code for the installation of all packages is provided below.
